### Best Practices

We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Configuring the compilation

The adapter template uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to compile TypeScript and/or React code. You can configure many compilation settings
either in `tsconfig.json` or by changing options for the build tasks. These options are described in detail in the
[`@iobroker/adapter-dev` documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#compile-adapter-files).

### Writing tests

When done right, testing code is invaluable, because it gives you the
confidence to change your code while knowing exactly if and when
something breaks. A good read on the topic of test-driven development
is https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92.
Although writing tests before the code might seem strange at first, but it has very
clear upsides.

The template provides you with basic tests for the adapter startup and package files.
It is recommended that you add your own tests into the mix.

### Publishing the adapter

Using GitHub Actions, you can enable automatic releases on npm whenever you push a new git tag that matches the form
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. We **strongly recommend** that you do. The necessary steps are described in `.github/workflows/test-and-release.yml`.

Since you installed the release script, you can create a new
release simply by calling:

```bash
npm run release
```

Additional command line options for the release script are explained in the
[release-script documentation](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#command-line).

To get your adapter released in ioBroker, please refer to the documentation
of [ioBroker.repositories](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#requirements-for-adapter-to-get-added-to-the-latest-repository).
